# Password Generator

This password generator allows the user to pick the components they are looking for.

They can select the following:
-lower case letters
-upper case letters
-symbols
-numbers
-length between 8-128 (choosen by slider)

Based on the users prefrences it will spit out a password with the criteria choosen.
The user can then copy this password using the "copy to clipboard" button.

## Future Development 

Unfortunately, this is just a snapshot of my skills in time and as I progress I would like 
to come back to this and create better functions that would guarantee at least one character 
from each checkbox. Right now it just randomly selects from a large string and it may never
can a character found in that check mark.

Other key components I would like to include:
    - saving of passwords
    - More styling - possibly bring into simple react layout
    - more secure
    - log in/log out/sign up features to create a password vault

If you have any suggestions please let me know at hay.design.lee@gmail.com.
