# Password Generator

    Application that uses JavaScript to generate a random password. Based on the users prefrences it will spit out a password with the criteria choosen.
    The user can then copy this password using the "copy to clipboard" button.

    They can select the following:
    -lower case letters
    -upper case letters
    -symbols
    -numbers
    -length between 8-128 (choosen by slider)

# Future Add's 

Unfortunately, this is just a snapshot of my skills in time and as I progress I would like 
to come back to this and create better functions that would guarantee at least one character 
from each checkbox. Right now it just randomly selects from a large string and it may never
select a character found in that check mark.

Other key components I would like to include:
    - saving of passwords
    - More styling - possibly bring into simple react layout
    - more secure
    - log in/log out/sign up features to create a password vault
